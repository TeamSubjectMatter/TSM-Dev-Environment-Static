# Set up
To get set up, clone this repository. Once you've finished cloning, run `npm instal` and then `gulp`.

After that, you should be good to go.

The task you'll use the most is `gulp watch`, which will start a local server, rebuild your css, js and html templates whenever you change a file and reload the browser at port 3000 (localhost:3000). To start development, just run `gulp watch` from your terminal.

Documentation on what each task does can be found in the js file for that task. All tasks live under `./gulp/tasks/`.
